              <p>People may wonder why I chose to be in CS/Data Science while my background is business. 
                I do not deny that I have a love of doing business which I inherited from my grandfather when I was a little girl. 
                And I was so fascinated to choose business as my career to pursue as I want to explore the world of it. 
                Yet, I realized that if I want to succeed in this world, I must study trends to determine different ways 
                through which I can make good strides to achieve positive results. And the new trend is Big data analytics. </p>
              <p>I like being challenged although I always struggle with pressure or even failure. But nothing is impossible 
                if the love for my career is big enough and failure is the best teacher in life. </p>
              <p>I started off my career as Logistics Analyst for a multinational company Logwin Air + Ocean 
                where I worked directly with the Country Manager to identify and measure key profit drivers 
                to maximize profit and minimize cost at the lowest risk. Thus, I was responsible for managing profit & loss 
                for all import shipments by following cash control/security procedures. 
                One of the major accomplishments that I’m most proud of was that I helped the company improve Inventory accuracy to 98% 
                by building an Excel Model that reduced manual calculation and increased reliability. </p>
              <p>From that position, I decided to pursue my MBA degree because I wanted to broaden my view about business. 
                Doing MBA degree really developed my project management, problem solving and teamwork skills. 
                I did not only learn a lot about business, finance, computer information systems but I also participated in many projects 
                to work with other people from different majors and backgrounds. For example, the last project that I participated in 
                was The Main Stogie Consulting project where we helped the owner of one of the best cigar stores in LA 
                improve his accounting practices and inventory management. With that project, we won the 1st place in Team Consulting Project in 2017. 
                Also, during the time I pursued my MBA degree, I got a job to work as a Finance teaching assistant 
                where I assisted Finance professor to develop knowledge, skills, and dispositions for 98 college students 
                to become successful finance leaders. Moreover, I got an intern to work for Strategic Growth Capital Holding LLC, Los Angeles. 
                My responsibility was reviewing the latest data on infrastructure spending across countries and asset classes, 
                updating the world’s infrastructure needs to assist the company to host the MENA Vision Foreign Direct Investment Expo 
                and to bring over 980 billion dollars in equity and debt financing for funding 360 projects. </p>
              <p>After completing my MBA degree at Cal State LA, I took a job as a Tax Research at H&R Block and later as a Payroll System Manager 
                at National Services Group to allow myself time to thoroughly think through my plans and to expose myself to a variety of work situations. 
                This strategy has been very valuable to me in rounding out my career plans. Spearheading the development and conversion of the Payroll System 
                gave me opportunities to work across teams to create guidance, develop a map with details about which companies 
                that will be migrated to the new system and their run dates and constantly testing the new system until all companies were migrated successfully</p>
              <p>During that process, I taught myself CS and Data Science by taking courses from Harvard University such as CS50X, 
                from IBM, Coursera, DataCamp, freecodecamp,…My journey to the world of Data Science hasn’t completed 
                but I am sure that I will learn a lot to transform my dream into action to be the best version of myself.</p>
