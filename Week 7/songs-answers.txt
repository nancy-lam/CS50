1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

First, we will calculate average energy, valence and danceability for example from the data in songs.db

SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
Average energy = 0.65906

SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
Average valence = 0.484443

SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
Average danceability = 0.71646

This person's music has high energy and danceability but the valence (measure of happiness) is lower than 0.5
so we can characterise the listener's audio aura as energetic, balanced in emotional expression, and dance-oriented

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Instead of using average for energy, valence and danceability, we should include other factors such as how many time that they play the music and use weighted average.
